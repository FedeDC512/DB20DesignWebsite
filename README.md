# db20design.github.io

This repo contains the code for the [db20design.github.io](https://db20design.github.io/) website, showcasing a simple layout designed for displaying Instagram posts dynamically. The header includes a sticky navigation bar with logo and title, alongside the Instagram and GitHub links. Posts are dynamically added to a grid based on the posts on the Instagram page. Each post includes an image and, if available, a clickable [Behance](www.behance.net) page link. The website is hosted using GitHub Pages, and the CSS is generated from a TailwindCSS output file.
